# Project Approach & Mission
## Peers looking for trust in the digitalverse

## Approach
Complete the development of the BNS functionalities associated to the zone files, profile.json, user and application profiles, did:web definitions, user web presence, application integration, and the verification and authentication of applications as SSO. Some of the code to be developed is to be used by applications in order to access the user profiles publicly.  Other code to be developed is to be used by the user of an application.
The developed code will be published as Replit extensions.

## Mission
This development effort has the mission to massify the adoption of Stacks Decentralized Identifiers (Stacks DID's) facilitated with the actual BNS.
The BNS names used as user profiles can be used as Single Sign On to thousands of applications.

## Methodology
To achieve this, we have defined a high level vision, specify the problem, and specify how to solve the problem with Internet, Blockchain, BNS, DID:WEB, user web presence and as Single Sign On solution.
Steps
### 1. Definition of a public accessible app’s profile and app user’s profile
      Deliverables
          Revised definition of the profiles did:web for the app's and app's users profiles.
### 2. Develop the App and User Profile code
      Deliverables
          Replit extensions in REACT javascript containing web presence for the did:web associated to the app or user profiles.
          Replit extensions in REACT javascript containing the functionalities to create or update the app or user profiles.
### 3. Develop a prototype of a user owned Application Single Sign On (SSO) based on did:web
       Deliverables
          Javascript code for the verification of a user functionality
          Javascript code for the authentication of a user to an application
### 4. A SIP proposal, Clarity trait, and examples for Blockchain Inscription service
          for Empowering the DID’s with Proof of the user National Identity
          for Agreements, Deliverables, and reference documents
