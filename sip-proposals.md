# SIP for Inscribing Immutable Data on Stacks

Use cases such as inscribing business contracts, commitments, National ID, membership, affiliations to companies.

Immutability is an attribute that Blockchain technology offers to world society. A transaction, and/or the execution of a smart contract that cannot be altered.

This attribute of immutability could be transformed in an inscription service applied to different purposes.
An example of this type of service are the Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) domain and subdomain names, and the second are the Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) inscriptions for art or music digital work.

The experience of less of a decade is showing that the Blockchain value finance trades have been led by humans and their relationships.  The BNS has addressed the need of a verified digital identity, but additionally there is a need to address the social identity.  These social identity represents the relationship between humans.

This proposal tries to cover an initial standard for the Stacks Smart Contracts for these social relationships. Weyl, et Al mayy 2022 Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul considers that commitments, credentials, and affiliations can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation.  

## 1.	Inscription of Commitments as business Agreements, payments, and business Deliverables.
### Commitments
Other examples taken from XCK.app are the business Agreements Inscriptions, payments, and business Deliverables Inscriptions. Ordinal inscription is another emerging inscription type stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Some of these inscriptions could be considered also as Soul bounded tokens (SBTs), enabling non-transferrable cryptoassets, specially for business Agreements, and business Deliverables.

The Stacks blockchain smart contracts can leverage the usability of the Bitcoin ecosystem, could help manage the inscription process of Ordinals that has started recently. An inscription is not sufficient as a solution of being the first doing it. It should have management rules, that users abide to, in order to have real meaning, and value. The BNS can be used to acquire, manage, and distribute ordinal inscription, as other type of inscription assets, both in the Stacks or Bitcoin ecosystems.

Inscriptions could be leverage with the use of did:web for the users, and apps. An app inscription or an inscription executed by a user could be accessed publicly by a web service using the did:web protocol. So ideally, Blockchain Inscriptions could be turned into a standard _Stacks Improvement Proposals_ - SIP. This standard could boost usability among other applications that reference this blockchain inscriptions. TXT records could be used at the zone file to connect BNS domains with inscriptions at ordinals.

## 2. Inscriptions of credentials ie Proof of the user's National Identity Document, and other type of identities.
### Credentials

In some specific use cases, probably, more in the formal space, some legal and business processes, its deliverables, and some cross border transfers, require that the participant users be identified by some valid legal national ID. DID profiles could be ideal to bound them a valid national identity document. 

Using a blockchain technological solution to bound a user's national identity document, for example, a national passport or national ID card, permitting a DID to be used by the user.  This is an authorizing and bound process to the DID, as a proof of identity. When users are interacting in a transfer or business agreement, this identity attribution could be shared between them. This utility of proof of identity could satisfy KYC (Know Your Customer) requirement of some country governments. In this case, regulation, executed in a decentralized way, controlled, and owned by each user.  

## 3. Inscriptions of affiliations to organizations, companies, institutions, and others.
### Affiliations

The proof identity should be an inscription of a DID bound to a National ID document, maintaining privacy, and security.  The user could share its proofs of identity with the corresponding peers, when necessary, with the correspondent National ID Inscription.  This type of inscription could be considered as Soulbound tokens (SBTs), a proposal for enabling non-transferrable cryptoassets that represent commitments, credentials and affiliations.

Another complementary Proof of Identity solution could be done by the reference of other users, that they know a certain user. Kind of a reputation ranking, like for example (https://trajan.app). At a certain, point one or more of the sponsoring users must have a more solid proof of identity issued by a valid legal national ID. These referrals can also be indicated in the user profile.
